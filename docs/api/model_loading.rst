Model Loading
=============

To use a model that has been trained on substra, you need to first download the files with the ``download_algo_files`` function.
These files are used to re-instantiate and load all variables to retrieve the user's Algo in its wanted state by the ``load_algo`` function.

An example on "How to download a model" is available in the Substrafl FedAvg on MNIST dataset example.
