# Even if empty this file is useful so that when running from the root folder
# ./connectlib is added to sys.path by pytest. See
# https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/explanation/pythonpath.html for more
# details.
# Eg, this allows to build extensions in place and run pytest
# docs/contribute/mistakes.rst and use connectlib from the local folder rather
# than the one from site-packages.
